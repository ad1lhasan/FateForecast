The Cosmic Vision
FateForecast is no mere applicationâ€”it's a portal to the unknown! Built on the bones of a Decision Tree Classifier, it deciphers the cryptic patterns of survival from a dataset of 500 passengers. With Flask as its mystical engine and a vibrant HTML interface, FateForecast invites you to input passenger details and witness the oracle's verdict: Survived or Lost to Fate. Ready to challenge destiny? ðŸŒ 
Epic Features

Prophetic Insights: Enter passenger detailsâ€”ID, Name, Age, Gender, Class, Seat Type, and Fareâ€”to unveil their fate in a heartbeat!
Astral Interface: A dazzling HTML form guides you through the cosmos, delivering predictions with flair and finesse.
Guardian of Errors: The oracle shields against chaos, gracefully handling invalid inputs or cosmic disruptions.
Encoded Mysteries: Categorical data (Gender, Class, Seat Type) is transformed into numerical runes using LabelEncoder for seamless prophecy.

The Data Galaxy
The heart of FateForecast lies in passenger_survival_dataset.csv, a celestial archive of 500 passenger souls. Each record holds:

Passenger_ID: A unique star in the cosmos.
Name: A mortal alias (encoded as integers for the oracle's sight).
Age: Years under the mortal sky.
Gender: Male (1) or Female (0), a binary constellation.
Class: Economy, Business, or First (encoded as integers).
Seat_Type: Window, Middle, or Aisle (encoded as integers).
Fare_Paid: The coin paid for passage.
Survival_Status: 1 (Blessed by Survival) or 0 (Claimed by Fate).

The dataset is transmuted into dependent_feature.csv after encoding, ready for the oracle's gaze.
Summoning the Oracle
To awaken FateForecast, follow these sacred rites:

Claim the Codex:
git clone https://github.com/ad1lhasan/FateForecast.git
cd FateForecast


Craft the Sanctum (optional but wise):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Gather the Runes:Ensure Python 3.11+ is your blade. Install the sacred dependencies:
pip install flask numpy pandas scikit-learn seaborn pickle5


Secure the Artifacts:

Place passenger_survival_dataset.csv and model.pkl in the projectâ€™s altar.
Or, forge a new model.pkl by channeling the passenger_survival.ipynb ritual.



Wielding the Prophecy

Ignite the Oracle:
python model.py

The portal opens at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Commune with Fate:

Journey to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.
Offer passenger details in the cosmic form and submit to receive the prophecy.


A Glimpse of Destiny:

Input: Passenger_ID: 1, Name: 0, Age: 52, Gender: 1, Class: 1, Seat_Type: 2, Fare_Paid: 822.34
Prophecy: "Survival Prediction: Did Not Survive" or "Survived"!

Forging the Oracle
The passenger_survival.ipynb is the crucible where the oracle is born:

Gathering the Stars: Load passenger_survival_dataset.csv with pandas.
Transmuting the Elements: Encode categorical columns (Name, Gender, Class, Seat_Type) with LabelEncoder.
Dividing the Cosmos: Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) realms.
Crafting the Oracle: Train a DecisionTreeClassifier, achieving ~56% accuracy on the test set.
Sealing the Prophecy: Preserve the oracle as model.pkl with pickle.

To reforge the oracle, chant the notebookâ€™s cells in sequence. Ensure dependencies (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn) are invoked.
